This repository includes printer profiles for tested printing 

  - Ender 5 - current main printer, optimised with easy to remove supports, corrected raft size to avoid wastage, and adjusted for PLA ERYONE. 
  nb, ender 5 has upgrade v1.5 motherboard, aluminium extruder and bowden tub. Such upgrades are highly recommended but profiles should still be consistent
